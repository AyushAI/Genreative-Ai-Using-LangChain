# 🌐 Generative AI Using LangChain

This repository demonstrates how to build and experiment with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Chat Models** from multiple AI providers — including **OpenAI**, **Gemini (Google)**, **Claude (Anthropic)**, and **Hugging Face** — using the **LangChain** framework.

---

## 🚀 Overview

LangChain makes it easier to connect different LLM providers through a unified API.  
This project brings together multiple models to help you:
- Compare performance across different LLMs
- Build cross-model pipelines for creative AI tasks
- Prototype intelligent agents and chat systems

---

## 🧩 Supported Providers
- **OpenAI** — GPT models (e.g. GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- **Gemini** — Google’s generative AI models
- **Claude** — Anthropic’s conversational models
- **Hugging Face** — open-source transformer models
